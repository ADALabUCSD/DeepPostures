We will now go over the steps to setup your environment, install and use DeepPostures. The library is written in Python and relies on PyTorch for deep learning. It can be used on multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, and Windows) as long as Python and PyTorch are avaliable.

If you need to access the TensorFlow implementation navigate to the branch "tensorflow" and follow the instruction in the README.
