# Installing DeepPostures

For the very first step, download the library from [GitHub Link](https://github.com/ADALabUCSD/DeepPostures) via: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ADALabUCSD/DeepPostures.git
```
Alternatively, you can directly download the [Zip File](https://github.com/ADALabUCSD/DeepPostures/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) (~300 MB), unzip the file, and change your working directory to the root of the repo/unzipped folder.

We will now assume all commands are executed from this directory. Within the repo there is a subfolder "MSSE-2021" for our paper.
The current repository is now migrated to PyTorch and only contains the implementation for "MSSE-2021". On this website, we use the code from "MSSE-2021" as it is the improved version. 

If you need to access the TensorFlow implementation navigate to the branch "tensorflow" and follow the instruction in the README.  Within the TensorFlow implementation, there are two subfolders "MSSE-2021" and "JMPB-2021" containing artifacts for our papers, respectively.
