# Get DeepPostures

For the very first step, download the library from [GitHub Link](https://github.com/ADALabUCSD/DeepPostures) via: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ADALabUCSD/DeepPostures.git
```
Alternatively, you can directly download the [Zip File](https://github.com/ADALabUCSD/DeepPostures/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) (~300 MB), unzip the file, and change your working directory to the root of the repo/unzipped folder.

We will now assume all commands are executed from this directory. Within the repo, there are two subfolders "MSSE-2021" and "JMPB-2021" containing artifacts for our papers, respectively. On this website, we use the code from "MSSE-2021" as it is the improved version.
