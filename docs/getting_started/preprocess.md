# Data Preprocessing
{: .no_toc }

First, you need to create pre-processed data from the source data. To do this invoke the `pre_process_data.py` script as follows:

    python pre_process_data.py --gt3x-dir <gt3x_data_dir> --pre-processed-dir <output_dir>

Complete usage details of this script are as follows:

    usage: pre_process_data.py [-h] --gt3x-dir GT3X_DIR --pre-processed-dir
                            PRE_PROCESSED_DIR
                            [--valid-days-file VALID_DAYS_FILE]
                            [--sleep-logs-file SLEEP_LOGS_FILE]
                            [--non-wear-times-file NON_WEAR_TIMES_FILE]
                            [--activpal-dir ACTIVPAL_DIR]
                            [--n-start-id N_START_ID] [--n-end-id N_END_ID]
                            [--expression-after-id EXPRESSION_AFTER_ID]
                            [--window-size WINDOW_SIZE]
                            [--gt3x-frequency GT3X_FREQUENCY]
                            [--down-sample-frequency DOWN_SAMPLE_FREQUENCY]
                            [--activpal-label-map ACTIVPAL_LABEL_MAP]
                            [--silent]

### Data format
- **Accelerometer Data**: We assume the input data is obtained from ActiGraph GT3X device and converted into single .csv files. The files should be named as **<subject_id>.csv** and files for all subjects should be put in the same directory. First few lines of a sample csv file are as follows:
    ~~~
    ------------ Data File Created By ActiGraph GT3X+ ActiLife v6.13.3 Firmware v3.2.1 date format M/d/yyyy at 30 Hz  Filter Normal -----------

    -0.179,-0.182,0.959
    -0.179,-0.182,0.959
    ~~~

    **Note:** The pre-processing function expects, by default, an Actigraph RAW file at 30hz with normal filter. If you have Actigraph RAW data at a different Hz level, please specify in the pre_process_data function using the gt3x-frequency parameter.

    **Note:** The expected .csv file must have the headers (first few lines) in the above format. Any other data format needs to be converted first. The data is usually very compressible, so we recommend compressing with gzip or equivalent before network transmission (don't forget to uncompress).
    
    **Note:** Our pre-trained models work and make predictions on time-series windows. If your data length is not an exact multiple of the window size, the last a few minutes that is not enough to make up a whole window will be dropped. This simply truncates the participant’s data period by a couple of minutes on average, resulting in slightly reduced wear time by a couple of minutes. This is usually not an issue in most scenarios, but if it matters for your task, you can pad the file with 0s at the end to fill the last window. Note the predictions on this last window would be somewhat unreliable due to the missing data.

    The CHAP development team recommends running CHAP on each participant’s full data collection period prior to removing periods of non-wear, sleep, etc. Using this approach, there are no gaps in a participant’s data from the beginning to end of their data collection period, so CHAP will run predictions on the entire data collection period. The CHAP time-series prediction window will only impact the final few minutes of the data period (at most), as long as non-wear, sleep, etc. are removed after running CHAP rather than before.

    

- **(Optional) Valid Days File**: A .csv file indicating which dates are valid (concurrent wear days) for all subjects. Each row is subject id, date pair. The header should be of the from `ID,Date.Valid.Day`.  Date values should be formatted in `%m/%d/%Y` format. A sample valid days file is shown below.

    ~~~
    ID,Date.Valid.Day
    156976,1/19/2018
    156976,1/20/2018
    156976,1/21/2018
    156976,1/22/2018
    156976,1/23/2018
    156976,1/24/2018
    156976,1/25/2018
    ~~~

- **(Optional) Sleep Logs File**: A .csv file indicating sleep records for all subjects. Each row is tuple of subject id, date went to bed, time went to bed, data came out of bed, and time went out of bed. The header should be of the form `ID,Date.In.Bed,Time.In.Bed,Date.Out.Bed,Time.Out.Bed`. Date values should be formatted in `%m/%d/%Y` format and time values should be formatted in `%H:%M` format. A sample sleep logs file is shown below.


    ~~~
    ID,Date.In.Bed,Time.In.Bed,Date.Out.Bed,Time.Out.Bed
    33333,4/28/2016,22:00,4/29/2016,10:00
    33333,4/29/2016,22:00,4/30/2016,9:00
    33333,4/30/2016,21:00,5/1/2016,8:00
    ~~~

- **(Optional) Non-wear Times File**: A .csv file indicating non-wear bouts for all subjects. Non-wear bouts can be obtained using CHOI method or something else. Each row is a tuple of subject id, non-wear bout start date, start time, end date, and end time. The header should be of the form `ID,Date.Nw.Start,Time.Nw.Start,Date.Nw.End,Time.Nw.End`. Date values should be formatted in `%m/%d/%Y` format and time values should be formatted in `%H:%M` format. A sample sleep logs file is shown below.
  
    ~~~
    ID,Date.Nw.Start,Time.Nw.Start,Date.Nw.End,Time.Nw.End
    33333,4/27/2016,21:30,4/28/2016,6:15
    33333,4/28/2016,20:40,4/29/2016,5:58
    33333,4/29/2016,22:00,4/30/2016,6:00
    ~~~

- **(Optional) Events Data**: Optionally, you can also provide ActivPal events data-especially if you wish to train your own models-for each subject as a single .csv file. These files should also be named in the **<subject_id>.csv** format and files for all subjects should be put in the same directory. The first few lines of a sample csv file are as follows:
    ~~~
    "Time","DataCount (samples)","Interval (s)","ActivityCode (0=sedentary, 1= standing, 2=stepping)","CumulativeStepCount","Activity Score (MET.h)","Abs(sumDiff)"
